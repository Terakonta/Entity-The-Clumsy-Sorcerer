# Entity-The-Clumsy-Sorcerer
This is my first game and the first time I made pixel art. I made it in Unity.  

Almost all the assets are my own, including sprites, projectiles, UI, particle effects etc. This was my first time working with state machine, physics, camera movement, collision detection, animation and such.
